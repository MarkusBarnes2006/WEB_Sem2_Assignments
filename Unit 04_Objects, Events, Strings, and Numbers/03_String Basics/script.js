I'd rather be with you, yeah
Yeah, I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Yeah I'd rather be with you

I'd rather be with you until I'm through
Oh yes I do
I'd rather be with you until that day we'll fly away
I just love that smiling face in the early sun
If I can't have you to myself, then life's no fun

I'd rather be with you, yeah
Yeah, I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Yeah I'd rather be with you

I want to hold you hand
Oh, if I can just be your man
I want to be you friend
Not now and then, but until the end

I just love the way you act, and that's a fact
I want to be your number one, so picture that

Maybe the next time
Maybe the next time
Maybe the next time
Maybe the next time

I'd rather be with you
Yeah
Yeah, I'd rather be with you

I'd rather be with you until I'm through
Oh, yes I do
I'd rather be with you until that day we'll fly away
I just love that smiling face in the early sun
If I can't have you to myself, then life's no fun

I'd rather be with you, yeah
Yeah, I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Yeah I'd rather be with you

Oh babe
Well, uh, you might think I'm trying to be funny
But I'm really serious this time, baby
    (I'd rather be with you, yeah)

Even though, uh, it's a cold world, baby
But you know deep down inside that I do love ya
I know I sound strange, but I really mean it(I'd rather be with you, yeah)

We gonna make it this time baby
        (I'd rather be with you, yeah) you're the only one I really love now
I'm coming at you with both hands tied behind my back, baby

            (I'd rather be with you, yeah) you got me, I'm coming at you, get ready
I'm gonna stick my love in your eye, baby (I'd rather be with you, yeah)

You can see me coming baby, just coming all over you
    (Yeah I'd rather be with you);
