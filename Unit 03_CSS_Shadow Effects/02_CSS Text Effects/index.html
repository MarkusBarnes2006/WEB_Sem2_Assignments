    <h1>Mozambique Drill by Mach Mach-Hommy </h1>

    <div>
        [Intro]
They don't know where they get their
Fake chains and jewelry from
They act like they on top of the world and soften

[Verse 1: Mach-Hommy]
The taxicab partition with the money tray
The crim around me had more expenses
The sauce convention was funny-faced
No half off, n***a this money wait
Flip you like Hacksaw Jim with the twenty gauge
No honey maid, I never did it for the gram (Uh, uh)
I had a vision I was willing to enhance
Went from 720 to 4K in one night, dumb nights
My forte is intuition sunlight

[Hook]
Play stupid games and win stupid prizes
Play stupid games and win stupid prizes
Play stupid games and win stupid prizes
Play stupid games and win stupid prizes, eh

[Chorus]
Eh, no content eh before re-hex
There's plenty n***as round
That been that want to spin you for the rep
No content take before recast
There's plenty n***as round
That been that want to spin you for a laugh

[Bridge]
You can't perform around us

[Verse 2: Mach-Hommy]
They ain't fucking over in the worst fashion (Uh-huh)
But if I get to yappin
It's gonna be a million purse snatchings
Get your napkins, crab rapper on the menu tonight
Now get it cracking, nah no snacking, I'm an Israelite
That shit I did was savage
All in the name of living lavish
Leviticus in tatters
Call the neighbors, get the package
And get this shit established like HUD homes

[Bridge]
Keep these fag bodied soft MCs out of your life man
They wanna be you they want your position
They want your turf buddy
They want your language and your style

[Hook]
Play stupid games and win stupid prizes
Play stupid games and win stupid prizes
Play stupid games and win stupid prizes
Play stupid games and win stupid prizes, eh

[Chorus]
Eh, no content eh before re-hex
There's plenty n***as round
That been that want to spin you for the rep
No content take before recast
There's plenty n***as round
That been that want to spin you for the

[Verse 3: The God Fahim]
Check it, ballpoint pins and weed no stems
How can you drop gems and you ain't got no M's
How could we ever blend how could we ever be friends
All I need is a medal in this life of sin
Yo what's the price again? I wanna know
Ain't no advice to give, I gotta go
With only one life to live I'm tryna grow
Idolize Jay and B.I.G. I love the dough, fo' sho'
My life revolves around science
It's survival of the wisest and the strongest who the highest
They all bother me the slightest
You dirty n***as is the virus
Why they sleep like the itus

[Outro]
But we can't cause they ain't gonna do nothing but run
Press charges, call the cops, start crying
And doing whatever's necessary to get you incarcerated
